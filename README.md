# Three.js Configurator

This project is a Three.js-based configurator tool designed to allow users to interactively customize 3D objects in GTLF and GLB formats. The configurator utilizes drag-and-drop functionality to manipulate objects, providing users with a seamless and intuitive experience for customizing their designs.

## Features

- **Interactive 3D Configuration**: Users can drag and drop 3D objects onto a canvas and manipulate them in real-time.
- **Support for GTLF and GLB Formats**: The configurator supports both GTLF and GLB formats, allowing for versatile object customization.
- **Designed in Blender**: All objects are designed in Blender, ensuring high-quality 3D models for customization.
- **Easy Integration**: The project is built using Three.js, making it easy to integrate into existing web applications.

## Getting Started

To get started with the configurator, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have a modern web browser that supports WebGL.
